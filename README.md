# RoboArm-Controller
These are the scripts used to control the robot arm, each script is tailored to a specific function and to work with a specific module

These scripts are made to work with the arduino uno and use the .ino file type to be imported into the arduino ide and uploaded to the arduino through there
if your code editor/uploader does not support this file type, you can copy paste the code and edit it to work such as I did in Visual Studio code

More scripts coming soon for different controllers:
RoboArm Computer controlled - The computer is meant to directly communicate with the RoboArm through serial communication using keyboard input

RoboArm 8 buttons - This script is for the 8 button controller made to communicate directly with the RoboArm, does not require computer to be connected to arduino (coming soon)

RoboArm 5 buttons mini - This script is for the 5 button controller made to communicate directly with the RoboArm, does not require computer to be connected to arduino (coming soon)

RoboArm Joystick 4 buttons - This script is for the controller made to communicate directly with the RoboArm, does not require computer to be connected to arduino (coming soon)
